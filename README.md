module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(scss|sass|less|styl|css)$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader',
          Stywrap.loader // Add Stywrap loader here
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  // Other Webpack configurations...
};
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Stywrap in your Web Component:

```javascript
import styles from './styles.scss';

class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    const style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = styles; // Inject styles into Shadow DOM
    shadow.appendChild(style);
    shadow.appendChild(document.createElement('div')).innerText = 'Hello, Stywrap!';
  }
}

customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);
```

## Supported Preprocessors
